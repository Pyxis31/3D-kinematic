# 3Dkinematic
This is an application based on OpenGL and writen in C for the rendering of a kinematic system in a 3D view
The camera point of view can be mofified by either the mouse movements or the IMU sensors of a smartphone
The joints angles can be changed by either the mouse too or by some LREAL datas coming from a SYSMAC omron controller through an OPC-UA connection
