# 3Dkinematic
This is an application based on OpenGL and writen in C for the rendering of a kinematic system in a 3D view. The camera point of view can be mofified by either the mouse movements or the IMU sensors of a smartphone. The joints angles can be changed by either the mouse as well or by some LREAL datas coming from an omron SYSMAC controller through an OPC-UA connection
